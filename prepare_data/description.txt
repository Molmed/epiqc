Merging strands, replicates and downsampling.
Example merge using SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_REP02.bedGraph.gz and SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_REP01.bedGraph.gz
Small scripts are tied together with two snakemake scipts:
merge_bedgraph.smk.py and downsample.smk.py

runit1_merge_strands_and_reps.sh and runit2_downsample.sh starts scripts on rackham using slurm.


Script: cg_coords.R

Find all CG-sites in chromosomes 1-22, X, Y and M in hg38 to make a list of 2bp intervals
[1] "Number of cg sites in reference chrs 1-22, X, Y, M: 29401795"

Script: strand_merge.R

Load bedgraph file from amazon bucket
[1] "Strandmerging ../new_bedgraph/SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_REP02.bedGraph.gz"

The number of cytosine positions in bedgraph:
[1] "Number of Cs assayed in bedgraph: 55738628"

and cytosine positions in bedgraph in chrs 1-22, X ,Y and M:
[1] "Number of Cs assayed in bedgraph chr1-22,X,Y,M: 55552635"

The number of 2bp reference CG intervals that intersects bedgraph data is:
[1] "Number of reference cg sites covered by bedgraph data: 28002937"

The number of bedgraph cytosine positions intersecting reference CG intervals is:
[1] "Number of bedgraph Cs intersecting reference cg sites: 55552635"
This is all positions in bedgraph in chrs 1-22, X, Y and M

reference CG intervals are intersected with bedgraph data and for each CG interval
methylated and unmethylated counts are summed.
This gives a total of:
[1] "Methylated Cs: 534678012 , unmethylated Cs: 268510206"
In file strandmerged_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_REP02.cov.gz
[1] "Wrote strandmerged file with 28002937 cg sites"


Load bedgraph file from amazon bucket
[1] "Strandmerging ../new_bedgraph/SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_REP01.bedGraph.gz"

The number of cytosine positions in bedgraph:
[1] "Number of Cs assayed in bedgraph: 55484162"

and cytosine positions in bedgraph in chrs 1-22, X ,Y and M:
[1] "Number of Cs assayed in bedgraph chr1-22,X,Y,M: 55300443"

The number of 2bp reference CG intervals that intersects bedgraph data is:
[1] "Number of reference cg sites covered by bedgraph data: 27958998"

The number of bedgraph cytosine positions intersecting reference CG intervals is:
[1] "Number of bedgraph Cs intersecting reference cg sites: 55300443"
This is all positions in bedgraph in chrs 1-22, X, Y and M

reference CG intervals are intersected with bedgraph data and for each CG interval
methylated and unmethylated counts are summed.
This gives a total of:
[1] "Methylated Cs: 378843524 , unmethylated Cs: 189915951"
In file strandmerged_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_REP01.cov.gz
[1] "Wrote strandmerged file with 27958998 cg sites"


Script: combine_reps.R

[1] "Merging replicate strandmerged files:
combined/strandmerged_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_REP01.cov.gz
combined/strandmerged_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_REP02.cov.gz"

Load replicate strandmerged files:

[1] "reading combined/strandmerged_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_REP01.cov.gz"
[1] "Number of sites: 27958998"
[1] "Meth Cs: 378843524 , unmeth Cs: 189915951"

[1] "reading combined/strandmerged_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_REP02.cov.gz"
[1] "Number of sites: 28002937"
[1] "Meth Cs: 534678012 , unmeth Cs: 268510206"

Merge the two files on keys chromosome CG site start and end coordinate.
[1] "Number of merged sites: 28077683"
Do rowsums on matched methylated and unmethylated counts of the two files:
Merged counts are:
[1] "Meth Cs: 913521536 , unmeth Cs: 458426157"

Write replicate merged file
[1] "Wrote replicate merged file: combined/repsCombined_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01.cov.gz"


Script: file_coverage.R
Compute coverage of replicate merged file.
Coverage is:
prep	sample	lab	total_cs	avg_coverage		median_cov	source_file
SPLAT   HG006   LAB01   1371947693      48.8625679334011        48      repsCombined_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01.cov.gz


Downsample file to average coverage 20:

Computing downsample fraction for NEB downsample script is done in the snakemake script downsample.smk.py
in function get_coverage2

20 / 48.8625679334011 = 0.40931 (rounded to 5 decimals, decide on precision?)

Script: downsample_methylKit.py

NEB downsample script is run with --fraction 0.40931 on file repsCombined_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01.cov.gz and writes downsampled_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_20x.cov.gz

Coverage after downsampling is:
prep	sample	lab	total_cs	avg_coverage		median_cov	source_file
SPLAT   HG006   LAB01   561533250       20.0867190507296        20      downsampled_SPLAT_HG006_LAB01_20x.cov.gz

I think that downsampling to a target of total number of cytosines counted instead of an average coverage target 
would perhaps be more precise and more eqvivalent to having the same number of reads in different samples compared, 
but it might not sound so good in writing to say downsampling was done to a count of 561533250 cytosines?
