# epiqc scripts

Scripts for data processing, analysis and visualization of EpiQC methylation data. 


### SLURM scripts

Scripts to be run on HPC (submitted to scheduler using SLURM). This folder includes scripts for:
* adapter trimming
* running each methylation pipeline (bwameth.slurm, Bismark.slurm, BitMapperBS.slurm, BSseeker2.slrum)
* downsampling bedGraphs generated by each methylation pipeline
* merging replicates into one bedGraph per library (e.g. combining bedGraphs from MethylSeq HG001 replicates 1 and 2)
* creating a timing comparison across all pipelines

### Rmds

R Markdown files that produce figures from analysis outputs. This includes:
* **Mapping.R**: generate figures for mapping efficiency and CpG detection
* CpG_Coverage.R to generate figures for genome-wide CpG coverage and genomic annotation
* CpG_Methylation.R to generate figures for global methylation percent estimations
* AlogComp.R to generate figures for comparing the outputs from each methylation analysis pipeline

### bin
Scripts to transform outputs in preparation for figure generation. This includes:
* combine_methylation_outputs.py to merge signal from multiple bedGraphs (leveraged in mergeReplicates.slurm)
* combine_methylBedGraphs.py to merge signal from 5mC data in methylBedGraph format (created by e.g. Megalodon)
* bsseeker2_to_bedGraph.py to pull CpG data frm BSseeker2 outputs and store in bedGraph format
