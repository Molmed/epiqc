# epiqc scripts

Scripts for data processing, analysis and visualization of EpiQC methylation data. 


# SLURM scripts

Scripts to be run on HPC (submitted to scheduler using SLURM). This folder includes scripts for:
* adapter trimming
* running each methylation pipeline (bwameth.slurm, Bismark.slurm, BitMapperBS.slurm, BSseeker2.slrum)
* downsampling bedGraphs generated by each methylation pipeline
* merging replicates into one bedGraph per library (e.g. combining bedGraphs from MethylSeq HG001 replicates 1 and 2)
* creating a timing comparison across all pipelines
